# Naming

Names should be self-documenting. No comments needed to understand what something does.

## Principles

- **Every letter matters** - no redundant words, no filler
- **Read like a book** - code should tell a story without comments
- **Say exactly what it does** - not more, not less
- **Prioritize clarity over brevity** - but be concise

## Variables

Use clear, descriptive names. No single-letter variables except loop counters.

## Functions

Use verb + noun pattern. Clear action, clear target.

## Classes

Say what it is. No redundant suffixes like "Helper", "Manager", "Utils", "Base", "Abstract".

## Files & Folders

Structure should be self-documenting. Each folder represents a clear architectural component.
